# loveletter: a CITS3001 project

CITS3001: Algorithms, Agents and Artificial Intelligence required us to create Agents to play the game 'Love Letter'.

Agents from each student then battle it out, fighting for the title as "most loved" (not an actual title).

Its not much, but feel free to look through the code!
